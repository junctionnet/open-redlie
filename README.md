# Redlie

This is a public Redlie code example. It includes the source files for the API calculation services and the web files that you can run on your local machine. To view the web page, simply install the dependencies. The web page has an API endpoint previously hosted in the cloud to check its functionality. Additionally, you can find test files to see examples of the API functions.
